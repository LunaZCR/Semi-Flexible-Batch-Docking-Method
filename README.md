# Semi-Flexible Batch Docking Method

The **Semi-Flexible Batch Docking Method** is an efficient molecular docking tool developed by **the Biocatalysis and Biotransformation Laboratory at Tianjin University of Science and Technology**.   This method is specifically designed to streamline large-scale molecular docking tasks, making it user-friendly for researchers.

## Key Features
- **Automated Workflow**: Automates the pre-processing of both receptors and ligands, simplifying the initial setup.
- **Automatic Parameter Acquisition**: Retrieves the necessary docking parameters automatically, reducing the time and effort needed for manual input.
- **Batch Processing**: Allows for simultaneous docking of multiple compounds, enhancing productivity in molecular design, biochemical research, and drug discovery.

## Benefits
- **Powerful Platform**: Leverage this tool for various applications in molecular design and drug development.
- **Flexibility**: The semi-flexible approach accommodates conformational changes in ligands, improving docking accuracy.

This method provides a robust and efficient solution for conducting molecular docking studies in an accessible manner.
